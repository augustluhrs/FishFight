# FishFight

Prototype fish creation on mobile populating a school of fish flocking around a pond.

## Thoughts

- Maybe rod cursor w/ bait is shown on the pond page and the schools seek it? With diff bait attracting diff fish -- also turns choosing which fish to fight into a challenge, you need to dodge the fish that you don't want to fight
- When the fish "upgrade", do you choose which of the four stats to bump?
- Are we doing fish reproduction? Could be interesting, but how are original creators notified that they have descendants? Do fish have family trees?
- How long does it take for a fish to grow/level-up/age? Is it only if they escape capture?
- Can the bystanders feed fish too? Or do fish only eat when they escape with the bait?
- Fin size independent or relative to body size?
- Can also select body type?
- Can also select diet preferences? (extra way to make fish unique, could be linked to powers/abilities)
- Whats character limit on names?
- What automod libraries are there for names?
- Should we display nametags on fish in pond? Or too cluttered?
- Is there even going to be a "pond"?
- I'm imagining Jojo-style fish art, where strong fish have huge, rippling arms and defensive fish have juicy butts.

## ToDo

- test on different devices/browsers
